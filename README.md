# User-Registration-with-ASP.NET-Core-v-2.1-and-Angular-7
Register a User To SQL Database with Angular (v 7) as Client-Side and ASP.NET Core (v 2.1) Web API as Serve Side.

I have followed a Tutorial on Youtube to Create this combo of Angular and ASP.NET Core Technologies. I have made some changes Angular views, rest of the Project is as it is explained inside the tutorial.
